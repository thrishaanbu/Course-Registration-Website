<center><h3>Python Programming</h3></center>
<p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.</p>
<center><h3>C++ Programming</h3></center>
<p>C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language.

The front end of a website is everything the user either sees or interacts with when they visit the website. It is responsible for the total look and feel of an online experience. While the term may sound a little technical, website front ends are really an everyday encounter for almost all of us.Writing website code with programming languages such as HTML, C++ and Java. Producing, maintaining and modifying websites and user interfaces. Incorporating applications, graphics, audio and video clips into client websites. Creating tools that enhance the user's website experience.
<h3>Let's divide Front End into 3 parts</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Html</li>
